# 📝 Task Manager (Upgraded Todo App)

This project is an **upgraded version of my earlier Todo app**, which initially had very basic features and limited control.

In this version, I **rebuilt the core logic from scratch**, focusing more on:
- proper state handling
- clean data flow
- task filtering
- real production deployment

This project helped me deeply understand how React apps actually work in real-world scenarios.

## 🧠 What I Learned From This Project

- How state flows between components
- Proper use of `useState` for real logic (not just demos)
- Filtering data instead of mutating it
- Debugging wiring issues (props, callbacks, ids)
- Difference between **development** and **production builds**
- Deploying a React (Vite) app correctly on GitHub Pages

This project cleared many confusions I had earlier about React logic and deployment.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- React (with Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)

---

## 🛠️ Work In Progress

- **Active tasks filter** is currently under development  
  (will be added in the next update 🚧)

## 📌 Note

This app is not just about UI.  
The main focus was **logic, wiring, and real-world behavior** of a React application.
